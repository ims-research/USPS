User Service Policy Server (USPS)
================

Proof of concept USPS.

This project forms part of a larger investigation into Dynamic Service Orchestration in the IP Multimedia Subsystem.

The User Service Policy Server is how the system captures the end user's input. It allows them to view available services, and to create customised service flows. In other words, it allows them to explicitly detail under which conditions a particular service should be activated. This is done through an HTTP web interface.

There is no documentation at the moment. Please leave some feedback if you are interested in the project.
